4.26.2022 Meeting Notes

## Midterm Project Summaries:

## Tucker

Tried GLM, GLMNET, MARS, and Naive Bayes
80/20 split, close CV results overall

Elastic Net - Highest AUC, test AUC of 0.737
- sex
- age
- cigs_per_day
- stroke
- hypertension
- cholesterol
- systolic bp
- glucose

## Zak

Tried GLMNET, GAM, MARS, KNN, LDA, QDA, NB
80/20 split
centering, scaling, and box-cox
10-fold CV repeated 5 times

MARS model performed best for AUC, Sensitivity and Specificity (0.5 decision boundary)
- age
- sex
- sys_bp
- cigs_per_day

Precision vs Recall - class imbalance
F-score

Tried upsampling

## Hun

Parametric vs nonparametric

Checked parametric assumptions, normality, independence, lack of multicollinearity

MARS and Supervised PCA - very little difference

Parametric - best was LASSO


## Final Project

Perform imputation, preprocessing(center, scale, box-cox)

Exploratory Analysis
